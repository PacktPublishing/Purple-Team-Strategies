## Purple Teaming Log and Report
Here you will find an example of the Purple Teaming Log and Report presented in Chapter 2 of the book. 
This is of course an example that should be adapted to your needs and environment but we hope it can serve as a main document for your first purple teaming exercise.

### A word on TTPs timeline
We would like to mention one particular aspect of emulating TTPs from a threat actor.
While MITRE is currently working on adding the concept of campaign on its repository, it is important to keep in mind that it currently list ALL TTPs observed and attributed to a threat actor.
Just as an example it means that if you try to emulate all TTPs from a threat actor named "X", you will end up emulating TTPs from this actor observed in 2019, 2021 and maybe 2022.
While it is not a real issue, the community needs to work on bounding TTPs with observation time so that we can specifically (and easily) select the latest TTPs from a particular threat actor.
